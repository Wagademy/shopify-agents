## 🌈 Part 1: Vibe Coding with [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)

We'll start by experimenting with **v0.dev**, a free and fast way to prototype UIs with natural language prompts.

- Try generating React components via prompt.
- Learn how v0.dev fits into modern frontend workflows.
- Discuss pros and cons of prompt-based development.

> 💡 Great for rapidly prototyping ideas and iterating with LLMs.
